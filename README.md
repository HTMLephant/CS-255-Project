# CS-255-Project
Module Eight Submission for CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a company that wants to design a platform that people can use to learn how to drive. The hub of the system is an interface through which the user can access driving exams, study materials, and a portal to schedule a driving appointment with a professional driving instructor.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did a thorough job in listing the functional and nonfunctional requirements for the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One thing I could improve is the Technical Requirements section of my system design document. I could improve it by being more thorough in what is required.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?
The user's needs is best represented by the UML use case diagram. It shows what the user can do on the platform as well as how other actors influence and manipulate the components of the service.

How do you approach designing software? What techniqes or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
It is always best to break down each requirement into concrete segments. These segments can be easily described in a small phrase and together they logically lead to a task being completed in the system.
